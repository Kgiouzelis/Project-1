        Our Story
    </h3>
    
    <h4>“Giouzelis Luxury Picnics” was born in Danville, California in 2021. Created with intentions of bringing people together by taking the stress away of organizing an special date and events for your loved ones by simply showing up and enjoying the top quality service we have to offer.
    
    We know how limited date options people have, or sometimes they have the idea but not enough time or the creativity to organize it, that’s why we came up with the idea of setting up the perfect scenario for your date, family or friends either if you want it in one of California's beautiful parks or at the comfort of your home. You let us know and we’ll deliver 100% satisfaction! We are heart driven by hospitality so we provide personalized experiences in each picnic.
